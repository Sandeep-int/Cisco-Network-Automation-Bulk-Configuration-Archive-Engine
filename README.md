# Cisco-Network-Automation-Bulk-Backup-Engine

## Overview
- In modern enterprise environments, manual configuration management is a bottleneck and a significant source of operational risk. I developed this project to automate the secure retrieval of running-config data from multiple network nodes simultaneously. Built with Python, Netmiko, and Linux (WSL), this engine serves as a foundation for scalable Network Programmability.
